# JiraDataExport
Scrapes data from an existing Jira build and creates or updates a set of relational tables in MS SQL Server. 

My project manager at my internship with Advent Software advised me to post this code on my personal Github since I had been working on a private repository. All server credentials have been removed and I received confirmation that Advent was both okay with this, and that this did not violate the NDA I signed with Advent.

This program makes batched calls to a hosted Jira build using the Jira API. It then deserializes the JSON objects that are returned from those API calls into a composition-based class structure of issues, fields, and field items. These data values are then passed to a set of relational tables using MS SQL Server calls. If tables already exist, the API calls are modified to dramatically reduce the run time and the tables are updated based on the unique Issue-Key. If not, tables are created and populated as the program loops through 1000 issues at a time. This is a limitation imposed by Jira so the pagination of items is the current workaround. 
The SQL data was used to create reports workspaces in Microsoft PowerBI as a proof of concept for what would be easily avaiable for managers and VPs without them having to create JQL statements in Jira or modify anything in the existing code base. The reports and the software are now being used for analytics on ticket handling, hour tracking, stories, epics, etc.
